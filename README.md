# Cpp_Project

# First week of project 
In the first lab I did a bit of research and looked through a few A* algorithm examples online to understand what it actually does like the open list, closed list and the heuristic. After that I set up my project with a simple oop structure 1 header file and 2 cpp files and made a basic grid using std::vector<std::string> so it’s easy to print and see what’s going on. I also added a Start (S) and Goal (G) point to make sure my coordinates and obstacles (#) are working properly before I start the real pathfinding. Right now the grid is still hardcoded and I haven’t added any checking or search logic yet, but that’s what I plan to do next thisisi just a general start. As you can see below is my Astar.cpp and teh code running.
